# Login with Tailwind CSS

This is a personal project that I made to test my Tailwind CSS skills, it's not the best but works for me. Also I did my best to make it totally responsible and mobile-friendly.

## To build

```
npm run build
```

## To check the result

```
Open the index.html file inside the login folder in your browser
```
